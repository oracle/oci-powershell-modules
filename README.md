## Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Modules for PowerShell

### About

[Oracle Cloud Infrastructure(OCI) Modules for PowerShell](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/ocimodulesforpowershell.htm) is a set of binary Cmdlet modules that can be used with PowerShell Core to manage Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources. These modules are written in C# using [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure SDK for .NET](https://github.com/oracle/oci-dotnet-sdk) and it provides Cmdlets(commands) that gives the same core functionality as the Oracle Cloud Console. Cmdlets offered by these modules can be invoked from the PowerShell command-line and with the associated PowerShell scripting language.

The project is open source and maintained by Oracle Corp.

### Supported PowerShell Versions

- PowerShell Core 6.0 and higher

### Install

#### From PowerShell Gallery:
The modules are published to [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/).

Install the modules from PowerShell Gallery using `Install-Module` as explained [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/powershellget/install-module).

```
#Install module for Audit Service
Install-Module OCI.PSModules.Audit
```

#### From Github:
PowerShell modules are published to [GitHub](https://github.com/oracle/oci-powershell-modules/releases).

* Download `oci-powershell-modules-artifacts.zip` file attached to the latest release in the Assets section.
* Extract `oci-powershell-modules-artifacts.zip` to a local directory.
* Register the extracted directory as the local PowerShell repository using the following cmdlet:
    ```powershell
    Register-PSRepository -Name "LocalRepo" -SourceLocation <extractedlocation>
    ```
* Find the modules available in the local repository using the following cmdlet:
    ```powershell
    Find-Module -Repository "LocalRepo"
    ```
* Install the desired module:
    ```powershell
    Install-Module -Name OCI.PSModules.Objectstorage -Verbose -Repository LocalRepo
    Install-Module -Name OCI.PSModules.Core -Verbose -Repository LocalRepo
    ```

### Configuring

Before using the cmdlets, set up a config file with the required credentials. See [SDK and Tool Configuration](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/API/Concepts/sdkconfig.htm) for instructions.

```
Import-Module OCI.PSModules.Common

#To setup a new config file
Set-OCIClientConfig
```

### Examples

Some examples can be found [here](/Examples).

### Building and Testing

#### Build

Modules can be built at the solution level or at the individual project level under the solution folder.
At the root level, to build all the modules, run the dotnet cli command:

```
dotnet build
```

Alternatively, individual projects(modules) can be built by using dotnet cli commands inside project directory.

#### Test

1. The repository has some Pester unit test scripts [unit tests](/Tests).
These test scripts can be run in PowerShell.

```
#Install Pester module
Install-Module -Name Pester

#Dot-source common utilities for tests
. ./Common.ps1

#Set the path to config file in an env variable
([Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("ConfigFile", "~/.oci/config"))

#Run individual test script
Invoke-Pester ./<<Test-Script>>.ps1

#Run all test scripts
Invoke-Pester
```
2. To test code changes, publish and import the service module.

Individual services can be published by executing the `dotnet publish` command from inside the project directory.
```
#Navigate to the project directory
cd <<ServiceName>>

#Publish assemblies
dotnet publish -o assemblies/
```
If you haven't loaded the required common module dependecy in your PowerShell session previously, load the common module.
```
cd ./oci-powershell-modules/Common/

Import-Module ./OCI.PSModules.Common.psd1
```

Import the published module into current PowerShell session from inside the project directory.
```
Import-Module OCI.PSModules.<<ServiceName>>.psd1
```
